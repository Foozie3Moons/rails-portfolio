  %h1.title.is-2.first Hi, I'm Matt
  %p.second
    I am a
    %span.primary.bold full stack web developer
    currently specializing in
    %span.primary.bold Ruby
    and
    %span.primary.bold Ruby on Rails.
    I love working with the full stack of an application, but feel more at home with the back-end.
    I like being able to see the big picture of an application so I can see how all the pieces fit together, and make sure that everything is communicating properly with one another.
  %h1.title.is-3.third My Passion
  %p.fourth
    My passion for coding came from an inability to solve simple problems in a fast and efficient way. Data stored in spreadsheets just does not cut it.
    So I started learning
    %span.primary.bold Ruby
    in my free time, and eventually used that knowledge to
    %span.primary.bold write useful scripts
    to automate tasks professionally, such as document parsing and data organization.
    I found that programming was my calling, and I enrolled in
    %span.primary.bold General Assembly's Web Development Immersive
    to reinforce existing knowledge in addition to learning countless new concepts.
    I'm excited to continue to learn and grow as I use and develop new technologies to solve problems big and small.
