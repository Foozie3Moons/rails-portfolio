  Matt was one of the leading students in the immersive from the very beginning.
  He has an inquisitive nature and a good mind for development. He always sought to learn and
  implement something above and beyond the assigned projects. He has a passion for data visualization
  and Ruby. I would recommend Matt to any employer.
